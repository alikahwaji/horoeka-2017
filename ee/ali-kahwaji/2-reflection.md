This week I took time to get familiar with jekyll and how to use it with github pages also the packages of chocolatey, beside that spent good amount of 
time learning HTML&CSS and how to get used with divs with ids and classes.

Again I'm trying my best to find the right time management to  balance my time between reading the materials and finishing my assignments, last week 
(sprint-2) I was not happy with my progress as I had to come to week 3 with some assignments from last still to do. Hopefully this week (sprint-3) I will 
do better and be more organized in reading and coding . Making sure to improve .2.7 Reflection
